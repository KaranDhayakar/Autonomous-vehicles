(d.1) How does NMS work?
NMS stands for Non Max Supression. It is used to reject multiple detection (bounding boxes) around the same object by finding their overlap. NMS takes values between 1 and 0. 0 NMS corresponds to no rejection. Increasing NMS, leads to higher supression. 

(d.2) How does NMS affect detections?
It Helps in supression of multiple detection of the same object. Thus different object can be delineated easilay.

(d.3) What is one way that NMS can help detection performance?
When multiple objects are in close proximity in an image, a higher NMS will ease the classification of each of the detected objects.

(d.4) What is one way that NMS can harm detection performance?
A higher NMS may supress detections of actual objects in an image. It may also reject detections of multiple objects when they are in close proximity.
